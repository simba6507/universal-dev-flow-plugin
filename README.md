# udflow — Universal Dev Flow (Claude Code plugin)

[![Validate](https://github.com/simba6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simba6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

**English** · [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

A risk-proportional, plan-gated multi-agent engineering workflow.
Understand → plan → **approve** → implement → verify → selected review → gatekeeper readiness verdict, with failure memory and optional external capabilities.

> In one line: udflow makes Claude Code lay out a plan and get your approval **before** it touches any code, then has the right specialist reviewers check the work, and finishes with a gatekeeper verdict on whether it's shippable — instead of just saying "done."

## Good to know (read before installing)

What you're opting into:

- **It uses more tokens than a normal chat.** One task can spawn the `implementer`, several reviewers, and the `gatekeeper`, and `security-reviewer` + `gatekeeper` run on `opus`. Expect noticeably higher token/cost usage than a one-shot edit. (Reviewers are chosen by risk, so simple tasks cost less.)
- **`opus` access:** `security-reviewer` and `gatekeeper` request `opus`; if your account/session can't use it, those steps fall back to the available model and verdict quality may vary.
- **Installing adds two hooks that run in *every* session — not only on udflow tasks:**
  - `plan-gate` (PreToolUse) is **invisible during normal work**; it only blocks `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit` **while you are in plan mode** — for any session while the plugin is installed, not just udflow tasks (Claude Code's own plan files are exempt, so the native plan flow still works).
  - `load-failure-memory` (SessionStart) reads your recorded past-mistake notes at the start of every session and injects a short **digest** so Claude avoids repeating them; if there is no such file, it does nothing.
- **It writes files.** The workflow may create `ai/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` in your repo (a new `ai/` folder) and `~/.claude/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` in your home directory. Decide whether to commit `ai/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or add it to `.gitignore`.
- **It can engage on its own.** udflow auto-starts for non-trivial engineering work even if you don't call `/udflow:run`, and stays out of trivial edits and plain Q&A. Use `/udflow:run` to force the full workflow.

## Quick start

Prerequisite: **Claude Code** installed.

**1. 🪟 In your terminal, go to your project and launch Claude Code**

    cd path/to/your-project
    claude

**2. 🤖 Inside Claude Code, install (run these three lines in order)**

    /plugin marketplace add simba6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin
    /plugin install udflow@kktmarketplace
    /reload-plugins

**3. 🤖 Hand it a task**

    /udflow:run Fix the login flow so it refreshes when the token expires

You can also just describe the task in plain language — udflow takes over automatically when it judges the work to be non-trivial engineering.

It then runs: understand → plan → present via **ExitPlanMode** for your approval → implement only after approval → verify → review → `gatekeeper` verdict. **No files are changed before the plan is approved.**

> **Stays out of the way for small stuff.** udflow only engages for non-trivial engineering work; trivial edits and plain Q&A are left alone. Want to force the full workflow on anything? Use `/udflow:run`.

### Updating to a newer version

Already installed an older version? Refresh the marketplace and reload — no uninstall needed:

    /plugin marketplace update kktmarketplace
    /reload-plugins

Custom marketplaces do **not** auto-update, so run `marketplace update` manually. Check the installed version in `/plugin`.

## How it works

```
understand → plan (plan mode) → you approve → implement → verify → selected review → gatekeeper verdict
                                                                  ↑________ repair loop ________↓
```

- **Understand / plan** happen in plan mode (read-only); the plan is presented via ExitPlanMode for your approval.
- **Only after approval** does the `implementer` write code.
- **Verify** runs build / test / lint / typecheck / browser evidence as applicable.
- **Review** selects only the reviewers relevant to this change's risk (no ceremony).
- **gatekeeper** returns `READY` / `FIX REQUIRED` / `NOT READY`; if a fix is needed it enters a repair loop until ready or clearly blocked.

## Example: roughly what a run looks like

Say you ask: "Add a *Remember me* checkbox to the login page." udflow walks you through it like this:

```
you> /udflow:run Add a "Remember me" checkbox to the login page

udflow> [understand] Restating: add a persisted "remember me" option on the login form.
        Clarifying: how long should the session be remembered? → asks via AskUserQuestion.
you> 30 days.

udflow> [plan / plan mode]  (read-only — no files changed yet)
        - Affected: login form component + the auth/session module
        - Approach: add checkbox → on submit, set a longer-lived session when checked
        - Verify: auth unit tests + open the page and confirm the checkbox works
        Presents the plan via ExitPlanMode and waits for approval.
you> approve

udflow> [implement] implementer makes the smallest change for the plan.
        [verify] runs tests/lint; opens the page and confirms the checkbox persists the session.
        [review] risk is UI + auth behavior → spec / test / ui-ux (+ security).
        [findings] test: missing a test for the unchecked default (major).
        [repair loop] adds the test → re-runs the affected reviewers → all pass.
        [gatekeeper] READY: requirement met, behavior verified, tests cover both paths.
```

Three things worth remembering:
- **Your files aren't touched before approval** — the plan is yours to approve.
- **Reviewers are selected by risk** — it doesn't spawn all of them every time.
- **Findings are auto-fixed and re-reviewed** — until the verdict is `READY` or it's clearly blocked.

## Components

- `skills/universal-dev-flow/` — the auto-invoked orchestrator (with `references/`).
- `skills/run/` — manual entry point: `/udflow:run <task>`.
- `agents/` — 9 subagents: `implementer` (writes) + 7 read-only reviewers + `gatekeeper`. `security-reviewer` and `gatekeeper` run on `opus`; the rest inherit the current session model.
- `hooks/` — `plan-gate.js` (PreToolUse: blocks writes while in plan mode, but exempts Claude Code's own plan files under `~/.claude/plans/` so it doesn't interfere with the native plan flow) and `load-failure-memory.js` (SessionStart: injects FAILURE_MEMORY). Both are Node scripts, so they behave the same on Windows PowerShell, macOS, and Linux.
- `.mcp.json` — empty by default (zero context cost). `mcp.example.json` is a copy-in template.

### The 9 subagents

| Agent | Role | When it's added | Model |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------|
| `implementer` | Implements the smallest safe change; never self-certifies | after the plan is approved | inherit |
| `spec-reviewer` | Requirement / business-rule / contract fidelity | core; always for non-trivial work | inherit |
| `test-reviewer` | Missing tests, weak verification, regression risk, edges | core; always for non-trivial work | inherit |
| `code-reviewer` | Local implementation quality, maintainability, framework usage, efficiency | non-trivial code changes | inherit |
| `security-reviewer` | Auth/authz, input handling, secrets, trust boundaries | security-relevant risk | opus |
| `architecture-reviewer` | Layering, boundaries, dependency direction, placement | structural/boundary concerns | inherit |
| `operability-reviewer` | Observability, retries/timeouts, deploy, rollback | runtime/production impact | inherit |
| `ui-ux-reviewer` | Usability, interaction, layout, states, accessibility | UI impact | inherit |
| `gatekeeper` | Aggregates and decides: READY / FIX REQUIRED / NOT READY | after selected reviewers finish | opus |

## Plan gate (approve before any change)

Steps 1–2 run in plan mode; the plan is presented via ExitPlanMode and **`implementer` only runs after approval**. A PreToolUse hook enforces read-only during plan mode (it only exempts Claude Code's own plan files so it never blocks the native plan flow).

To start every session in plan mode, set a default mode in your own `~/.claude/settings.json` or the project's `.claude/settings.json` (the plugin does not force it).

---

## Failure memory

udflow records "execution abnormalities that blocked, disrupted, or forced repair of the intended method" as plain Markdown, so future sessions read past lessons on startup. It uses two files (either or both):

- Project-level: `ai/FAILURE_MEMORY.md`
- Global: `~/.claude/FAILURE_MEMORY.md`

### How it's loaded and used (three stages)

1. **Startup digest (automatic, via hook).** The `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/load-failure-memory.js`) runs on every start/resume/clear and injects a **condensed digest** — each entry's title + prevention rule + tags, newest first, capped — using **project first → global fallback**. It's a small index, not the whole file; if neither file exists it skips silently. (Files that don't follow the template fall back to an entry-aware excerpt of the newest content.)
2. **Targeted recall (during planning).** Once the task is known, the workflow searches the file for entries relevant to the affected files / area / language / `Tags` and reads those full entries — so only relevant lessons surface, not the entire history or a blind dump.
3. **Consolidation (keeps the file small).** Size is controlled by merging duplicates, folding recurrences, and pruning obsolete entries — by entry count, not by truncation. The startup cap is only a safety net.

### Write (driven by the workflow, routed by the lesson's nature)

The write target depends on **what kind of lesson it is**, not a fixed order:

- **Project-specific** lesson (only relevant to this repo) → `ai/FAILURE_MEMORY.md`.
- **Cross-project** lesson (tooling, process, reviewer coordination — applies elsewhere too) → `~/.claude/FAILURE_MEMORY.md`.
- **Both apply** → write the project file and also update the global file when the prevention rule is reusable across repos.
- `gatekeeper` decides whether an entry is needed: prefer the project file when it exists/applies, otherwise the global file.

Whichever side it writes, it **rereads the global `~/.claude/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` first** to merge with a similar existing entry (marking recurrences) instead of creating scattered duplicates. A filled-in example lives at [`examples/FAILURE_MEMORY.sample.md`](examples/FAILURE_MEMORY.sample.md).

> In one line: **read = a small digest at startup + targeted recall during planning (project-first, global-fallback); write = routed by the lesson's nature (project-specific → project, general → global, both → both), always rereading global first; size is kept down by consolidation, not truncation.**

## Optional external capabilities (Detect → Use → Else-Disclose)

MCP tools, external subagents, and external skills are all **optional**. If present, they're used; if absent, the work is done locally and the gap is disclosed. See `skills/universal-dev-flow/references/external-capabilities.md`.

- **MCP per reviewer**: disabled by default. To enable, copy a server from `mcp.example.json` into `.mcp.json`, then uncomment the matching `mcp__*` line in that reviewer's `tools:`. Keep reviewers read-only.
- **ui-ux-pro-max**: if the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill is installed, udflow uses it first for UI design decisions and in `ui-ux-reviewer`; otherwise it falls back to built-in guidance and discloses that.
