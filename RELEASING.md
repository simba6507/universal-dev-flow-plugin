# Releasing udflow

Releases are **automatic**: pushing to `master` runs CI, and when the manifest version is new the
`release` job tags it and publishes a GitHub release from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section. You
never tag by hand. This file is the **manual pre-release smoke** for the one thing CI cannot prove.

## What CI already gates (automatic, on every PR + push)

- `validate-structure.mjs` — manifests parse; `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` / `package.json` /
  `CHANGELOG.md` versions agree; SKILL-linked references and wired hooks exist; **hook wiring** (each
  lifecycle hook registered under the right event with a matcher that covers the tools/lifecycles it
  must fire for); distribution hygiene; text integrity; bilingual README parity.
- `node --check` on all five hooks; `node --test` (behavioral hook tests).
- `claude plugin validate` — **best-effort, non-blocking** (Linux-only; the Claude Code CLI may not
  run fully headless in CI).

CI proves the hook **scripts' logic** and the **packaging/wiring**, but it cannot prove that a real
Claude Code session actually loads and fires the plugin after install — that needs a live runtime and
auth, which is why `claude plugin validate` is best-effort. Do the check below by hand before (or
right after) a release that touches hooks, the skill, `hooks.json`, or the manifests.

## Manual activation smoke (clean profile)

In a throwaway/clean Claude Code profile, from a scratch project directory:

1. **Install + enable + reload**
   - `/plugin marketplace add simba6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin`
   - `/plugin install udflow@kktmarketplace`
   - `/plugin` → **Installed** → toggle **udflow** on (or `claude plugin enable udflow@kktmarketplace`)
   - `/reload-plugins`
2. **SessionStart hook** — put a tiny `ai/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` with one `### ` entry in the project,
   start a fresh session, and confirm the failure-memory **digest** (titles + tags, nonce-fenced,
   labeled untrusted) is injected. With no file, nothing should appear.
3. **PreToolUse plan gate** — enter plan mode and ask Claude to edit a file; the write must be
   **denied** with the plan-gate reason. Outside plan mode the same edit is allowed.
4. **Stop / orchestration-check** — end a session that asserts a `READY` verdict without running the
   panel; confirm the advisory `systemMessage` appears (and that an honest run stays silent).
5. **PreCompact / compaction fidelity** — with `udflow` enabled, trigger a compaction (`/compact`, or
   let auto-compaction fire on a long session) and confirm the preservation reminder is injected: a
   `<<UDFLOW_PRESERVE_…>>` block naming reviewer/gatekeeper verdicts, acceptance-criteria state,
   `[unverified]` flags, and the `udflow:verify=` / `udflow:delivery=` sentinels. With
   `"udflow": { "preserveOnCompact": false }` in the project's `.claude/settings.json`, nothing should
   appear. (The hook's I/O contract is unit-tested and smoke-verified through the verbatim `hooks.json`
   bootstrap; this step confirms Claude Code's compactor actually fires the hook.)
6. **Skill activation** — describe a non-trivial engineering task in plain language and confirm the
   `universal-dev-flow` skill engages (or `/udflow:run <task>` invokes it manually).

If any step fails, do **not** rely on the release for that surface — fix and re-run. Note the result
in the PR or the `EVIDENCE.md` log so the activation path has a paper trail.
