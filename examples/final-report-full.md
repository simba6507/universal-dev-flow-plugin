# Full final report example

Source: shaped from `EVIDENCE.md` Live run 5.

This is an illustrative full-report shape using real evidence-log facts. The exact original report is not reconstructed; sections marked "example" show how a full report can present the evidence.

URL note: `EVIDENCE.md` records historical `simba6507` URLs from the time of the run; this example uses the current canonical `kktu6507` repository URL after transfer.

## Summary

- Implemented four contract-file enhancements: live browser evidence for `--deep` + UI, split `--report full` cost columns, `ui-ux-pro-max` planning requirement for design-system scope, and final changed-UI screenshots in `--report full`.

**Outcome** - requirement -> change -> effect:

| Requirement / acceptance criterion | What changed | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Browser evidence for deep UI work | Added browser-driving and runtime-gap disclosure contract text. | UI runs have clearer evidence expectations without making this repo pretend it has a web UI. |
| Split full-report cost columns | Added Input / Output / Cache-write / Cache-read guidance and validation. | Cost reporting is more honest about billable components. |
| `ui-ux-pro-max` planning requirement | Added capability-consultation and fallback wording. | Design-system scope gets stronger review when the capability exists. |
| Final changed-UI screenshots | Added changed-state and data-sensitivity rules. | Screenshots are useful evidence without encouraging unsafe public disclosure. |

**Per-agent activity**:

| Agent | What it did | Found | Fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| implementer | Updated contract docs, validator guard, version, and CHANGELOG. | n/a | n/a |
| spec-reviewer | Checked acceptance criteria and contract wording. | 1 real scope-binding ambiguity | yes |
| test-reviewer | Checked validator and verification depth. | guard coverage gaps | yes |
| architecture-reviewer | Checked reference-file placement. | minor anchor/placement issues | yes |
| security-reviewer | Reviewed browser/session and screenshot leakage risk. | 2 major findings | yes |
| ui-ux-reviewer | Reviewed UI evidence wording. | minor clarity issues | yes |
| operability-reviewer | Reviewed artifact handling and runtime disclosure. | artifact `.gitignore` issue | yes |
| code-reviewer | Reviewed validator JavaScript added in repair. | no blocker after repair | yes |
| gatekeeper | Aggregated findings and verdict. | FIX REQUIRED -> READY | yes |

## Files Changed

| File | What / why |
|---|---|
| `udflow/skills/universal-dev-flow/references/final-report.md` | Full-report cost and screenshot evidence contract. |
| `udflow/skills/universal-dev-flow/references/browser-evidence.md` | Browser-driving, no-destructive-interaction, and data-sensitivity guidance. |
| `.github/scripts/validate-structure.mjs` | Regression guard for cost-table columns. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` and plugin manifests | Version bump and release notes. |

## Assumptions

- No hooks or machine-token literals should change.
- Browser runtime behavior cannot be exercised in udflow's own repo because it has no web UI.
- Screenshot evidence can contain secrets or PII and must be protected.

## Verification

**Checks** (exit status, not opinion):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `node .github/scripts/validate-structure.mjs` | pass, including the new 5e guard |
| `node --test` | pass: 127 pass / 0 fail / 4 pre-existing Windows-symlink skips |
| Hooks byte comparison | pass: unchanged |
| GitHub CI | pass on macOS / Ubuntu / Windows |

- Not run / uncertainty: actual browser driving and screenshot capture could not be exercised in this repo because it has no web UI.
- Acceptance criteria: 6/6 met for the contract/documentation scope; runtime browser behavior disclosed as not exercisable here.
- External capabilities: Claude in Chrome and `ui-ux-pro-max` were contract requirements for downstream runs, not available/needed for this repo's docs-only implementation.
- UI/UX evidence: no UI/UX impact in this repo.

**Cost** (no telemetry; observed vs estimated):

| Agent / phase | Input | Output | Cache-write | Cache-read | New | Share | Source | ~Cost |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|---|--:|
| implementer | not reported | not reported | not reported | not reported | ~109K | n/a | observed total only | n/a |
| deep panel R1 | not reported | not reported | not reported | not reported | ~783K | n/a | observed total only | n/a |
| repair panel R2 | not reported | not reported | not reported | not reported | ~369K | n/a | observed total only | n/a |
| orchestrator | not reported | not reported | not reported | not reported | ~250K | n/a | estimate | n/a |
| **Total** | not reported | not reported | not reported | not reported | **~1.51M** | n/a | observed + estimate | n/a |

## Findings

| Severity | n | Detail |
|---|--:|---|
| blocker | 0 | none after repair |
| major | 2 | Browser evidence could expose authenticated session data; embedded screenshots could leak sensitive states. Both fixed. |
| minor | 5 | `.gitignore` self-ignore issue, scope-binding ambiguity, optional-capability wording, changed-state definition, and a doc anchor. Fixed before delivery. |

## Missing Tests

- No live browser-driving or screenshot-capture test exists in this repo because the repo has no web UI. The gap was disclosed.

## Risks

- Browser and screenshot evidence can carry secrets or PII. Reports should avoid public sensitive screenshots unless they are sanitized.
- The `ui-ux-pro-max` capability must be treated as optional with explicit fallback disclosure when unavailable.

## Failure Memory

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Required | not required in the evidence log example |
| Reason | findings were repaired and already captured in the contract docs / validator guard |
| Entry added | no |

## Final Verdict

- **READY**

## Evidence Record

Evidence tier: publicly verifiable maintainer run.

### Live run - 2026-06-26 - `universal-dev-flow-plugin` (Markdown / Node JS) - verified live task

- Task: implement four user-requested enhancements into udflow's own contract files, plus the 0.23.0 version bump and CHANGELOG.
- Intent given: contract-level; six acceptance criteria plus three design forks resolved before editing.
- Reviewers: spec / test / architecture / security / ui-ux / operability + adversarial verification + gatekeeper; code-reviewer added in the repair round. Verdict: FIX REQUIRED -> READY.
- Verification: `node .github/scripts/validate-structure.mjs`; `node --test`; hooks byte-unchanged; GitHub CI.
- Caught: two major security findings around authenticated browser evidence and sensitive screenshots; several minor contract/artifact issues. All fixed before merge.
- Missed: none known at finish; actual browser-driving runtime was not exercisable in this repo and was disclosed as a gap.
- False alarms: none; one spec major was a real ambiguity correctly down-rated by gatekeeper.
- Outcome after follow-up: merged in PR #30 and auto-released as `v0.23.0`; compat follow-up PR #31 recorded Copilot live verification.
- Cost: ~1.51M new tokens across two workflow runs. Evidence: https://github.com/kktu6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin/pull/30
