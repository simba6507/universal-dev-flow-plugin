# Compact final report example

Source: shaped from `EVIDENCE.md` Live run 4.

Evidence tier: publicly verifiable maintainer run.

This is an abridged compact report example. It preserves real facts from the evidence log but is not a verbatim transcript.

URL note: `EVIDENCE.md` records historical `simba6507` URLs from the time of the run; this example uses the current canonical `kktu6507` repository URL after transfer.

## Summary

- Implemented the approved spec/docs updates for udflow's contract reference files: filtered-diff retrieval pointer, content-type noise filtering, cache-friendly context ordering, and tagged cost-estimate basis. No code, hook, or machine-token behavior changed.

## Verification

**Checks** (exit status, not opinion):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --test` | pass: 128 pass / 0 fail / 2 environment-conditional skips |
| `node .github/scripts/validate-structure.mjs` | pass |
| `claude plugin validate .` | pass |
| `claude plugin validate ./udflow` | pass |
| GitHub CI | pass on macOS / Ubuntu / Windows |

- Acceptance criteria: 6/6 met; no deferred criteria.
- Cost: ~199K new tokens; tier: deep; observed implementer/panel figures plus orchestrator estimate.
- External capabilities: none required.

## Findings

| Severity | n | Detail |
|---|--:|---|
| blocker | 0 | none |
| major | 0 | none |
| minor | 1 | Cost-basis prose could be read as mismatching the unchanged full-report Total-row `Source` literal; fixed before delivery. |

## Final Verdict

- **READY**

### Live run - 2026-06-26 - `universal-dev-flow-plugin` (Markdown / Node JS) - verified live task

- Task: implement points 1-4 of a `headroom`-vs-udflow design comparison into udflow's own contract reference files, plus the 0.22.0 version bump and CHANGELOG.
- Intent given: contract-level; six numbered acceptance criteria with exact before/after strings.
- Reviewers: spec / test / architecture + adversarial verification + gatekeeper. Verdict: READY.
- Verification: `node --test`; `node .github/scripts/validate-structure.mjs`; `claude plugin validate .`; `claude plugin validate ./udflow`; GitHub CI.
- Caught: one real minor wording mismatch in cost-basis prose, fixed before merge.
- Missed: none known at finish; to confirm in follow-up use.
- False alarms: none.
- Outcome after follow-up: merged in PR #28 and auto-released as `v0.22.0`; long-term verdict still to be confirmed.
- Cost: ~199K new tokens. Evidence: https://github.com/kktu6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin/pull/28
