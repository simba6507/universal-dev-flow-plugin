# Deep Mode (ultracode / Workflow leverage)

Deep mode makes the review/repair core **deterministic** instead of model-followed prose: the selected reviewer panel, the gatekeeper barrier, and the repair loop are expressed as a Workflow so they actually run. It follows udflow's Detect → Use → Else-Disclose protocol and never becomes a hard dependency. A skill cannot enable ultracode (it is a harness mode); deep mode only detects the signal and adapts.

Deep mode raises **depth, not breadth.** The reviewer *selection* is unchanged — still the smallest sufficient set from `reviewer-selection.md`. It never adds reviewers.

The downward cost knob is separate: `--lite` (see `reviewer-selection.md`, *Lite path*) lowers **breadth** — it forces the smallest panel and skips deep mode for small, low-risk changes, the counterpart to `--deep` raising depth. Deep manages the depth ceiling; lite manages the breadth floor (with a safety floor that keeps a needed safety reviewer and discloses it). Both are opt-in and orchestrator-followed.

## Two tiers (enforcement is cheap; extra effort is not)

Deep mode is split into two tiers so its *enforcement* benefit can be had cheaply without paying its *cost*:

- **Tier 1 — deterministic enforcement.** Express the **already-selected** panel as a Workflow `parallel` barrier and the gatekeeper as a `pipeline` barrier, so the panel actually runs and gatekeeper only runs after it. **Same reviewers, same model, same reasoning effort** as the standard flow — the only change is that the orchestration is *enforced by the graph* rather than left to model self-discipline. Because it adds no effort, its token cost is ≈ the standard flow. **This is the tier that may auto-engage** (see Detect).
- **Tier 2 — deeper verification (raises cost).** On top of Tier 1, add **adversarial verification** of blocker/major findings, **loop-until-dry** repair, and **maximum reasoning effort** for `gatekeeper` / `security-reviewer`. This materially raises tokens/wall-clock, so it stays **explicit opt-in** (per the Auto-fix loop's cost-control rule in `SKILL.md`) — never auto-engaged.

## Detect

Signals (none a hard dependency):

1. A session-level ultracode signal (e.g. a SessionStart `additionalContext` / system-reminder indicating ultracode is on).
2. An explicit per-task opt-in: `/udflow:run` arguments beginning with `--deep`, `deep:`, or `ultra:` (this requests **Tier 2**).
3. The Workflow capability actually exists for the running orchestrator.

How the signals map to the tiers:

- **Tier 1 auto-engages** when the task is **high-risk or correctness-critical** (per the `reviewer-selection.md` Risk Matrix) **and** the Workflow capability is available (signal 1 or 3). No `--deep` needed. It is **opt-out**: a `--no-deep` / `--shallow` argument — or simply no Workflow capability — falls back to the standard prose flow. Because Tier 1 doesn't raise effort, auto-engaging it does **not** trip the "confirm before an opus-heavy pass" cost rule.
- **Tier 2 requires explicit opt-in** (signal 2, or a user confirmation) **and** the Workflow capability. Intent without capability → fall back and disclose.

For low/medium-risk work neither tier auto-engages — the standard prose flow runs unless `--deep` is given.

## Use

When the Workflow capability is available:

**Tier 1 (enforcement — auto or opted in):**
1. **Panel as a `parallel` barrier** — the selected reviewers each run as a Workflow agent that returns a schema-validated finding set. Reuse the existing output contract in `reviewer-common.md`; do not invent a new schema. Each agent still receives only its own focused Review Packet, preserving reviewer independence.
2. **Gatekeeper as a `pipeline` barrier** — gatekeeper runs only after the panel barrier completes (encoding the `runtime-policy.md` rule as control flow, not prose).

**Tier 2 (only when explicitly opted in — adds cost):**
3. **Adversarial verification** — for each blocker/major finding, fan out 2–3 independent verifiers and keep only findings supported by a majority.
4. **Loop-until-dry repair** — implement → verify → review repeats until a round produces no new blocker/major (still subject to the Auto-fix loop's hard iteration cap and Stuck Summary).
5. **Effort** — run `gatekeeper` and `security-reviewer` at maximum reasoning effort; low-risk leaf reviewers use the default.
6. **App launch** — when verification needs a live process (a web app for browser evidence, or a backend/API server for integration checks) that is **not already running**, bring it up per `references/app-launch.md` (Detect → Use → Else-Disclose): attach if already up; else delegate to the built-in `/run` skill (then `mcp__Claude_Preview__*` `preview_start`, then a documented repo run command), auto-launching without a second prompt (`--deep` is the opt-in) but **disclosing** that it launched; tear down only what udflow started. An app that cannot be launched is a disclosed gap the gatekeeper weighs — never an error.
7. **Live browser evidence** — when UI is in scope, drive the real browser (`references/browser-evidence.md`) as a *required* verification step (Detect → Use → Else-Disclose), after the app is reachable (item 6); an unavailable browser capability is a disclosed gap the gatekeeper weighs. This adds vision-token cost, consistent with Tier 2 being the cost-raising, opt-in tier.

## Else (no Workflow capability, or opted out)

Run exactly the standard prose flow. **The enforcement guarantee is bounded to Workflow-capable sessions:** without the capability udflow cannot make the panel run deterministically — it falls back to model-orchestrated prose (the panel is still *selected* and *run*, just not graph-enforced). If Tier 1 would have auto-engaged (high-risk) but no capability exists, or if `--deep` (Tier 2) was requested and is unavailable, add one line of disclosure: the deterministic Workflow was unavailable, so the standard flow ran and the panel was model-orchestrated rather than graph-enforced. Never error on absence.

When `--deep` was requested, the **app-launch obligation (Tier 2, item 6) and the live browser-evidence obligation (Tier 2, item 7) still apply in this fallback** — they are verification steps keyed on `--deep` + a needed live process / UI scope, not graph-enforcement nodes, so only the graph-enforcement is lost; an app that cannot be launched, or an unavailable browser, remains a disclosed gap the `gatekeeper` weighs.

## Invariants in both modes

- The plan gate and failure-memory hooks are active in both modes; deep mode changes neither hook and the hooks must never depend on deep mode.
- Plan approval (ExitPlanMode) stays human-in-the-loop; the Workflow does not take it over.
- **Cost stays proportional.** Tier 1 adds enforcement at ≈ standard cost and may auto-engage on high-risk work; Tier 2 raises effort and is **never** auto-engaged — it needs `--deep` or an explicit confirmation, honoring the `SKILL.md` Auto-fix loop cost-control rule.
- The conditional plan-grounding step (`references/plan-grounding.md`) runs the same in both modes; in deep mode its Stage A grounding may run as a read-only Workflow agent node, but it never changes reviewer selection.
- Roles, severity vocabulary (`blocker`/`major`/`minor`), and the verdict set (`READY`/`FIX REQUIRED`/`NOT READY`) are unchanged, so a deep run and a standard run are directly comparable — only enforcement, verification depth, and effort differ.
