# Review Packet

Use a Review Packet before handing work to any reviewer. The packet is the reviewer source of truth. Do not use full thread history as the default reviewer input.

## Required Fields

- Task summary: one concise statement of the requested change.
- Acceptance criteria (user-approved): a numbered checklist of observable, verifiable outcomes that define done — approved by the user at the plan gate. The `gatekeeper` checks each item (met / unmet / deferred; see `agents/gatekeeper.agent.md`), and an unmet, non-deferred criterion blocks `READY`. They are approved as part of the plan at ExitPlanMode — not a separate approval step. On high-risk work these are the plan-grounding **sharpened contract**.
- In scope: workflows, files, modules, or user-visible behavior reviewed.
- Out of scope: adjacent behavior intentionally not changed, plus work the plan/user explicitly **deferred**. Reviewers must treat these as intentional, not as missing-omissions (deferred ≠ missing — see the Shared reviewer contract).
- Assumptions: only assumptions that affected implementation or verification.
- Implementation summary: what changed and why.
- Changed files: paths and short purpose for each relevant changed area.
- Changed diff (filtered): a filtered, capped unified diff produced once by the orchestrator, given to every reviewer as a shared starting point so each reviewer need not re-run the base diff. State a **retrieval pointer** alongside it — what was trimmed (the cap, the path scope, excluded paths, any truncated hunks) and the exact command to regenerate the *same-scoped* untrimmed diff — so a reviewer who needs more follows a pointer instead of reconstructing what was dropped or running a bare `git diff` that yields a differently-scoped view. When the filtered diff is large enough that inlining it into every reviewer's packet is wasteful, the orchestrator MAY instead write it once to `output/udflow/review/diff.patch` and hand that **path** (plus the same retrieval pointer); small diffs stay inline, and on any write failure fall back to inline. Path-vs-inline is a token/cache optimization only (it slims the per-reviewer prompt and keeps the shared prefix byte-stable — `references/runtime-policy.md`, Context Ordering); it never changes what a reviewer may read. The file is a kept run artifact, gitignored (`references/verification-gate.md`, Artifact Hygiene). This applies only to the diff; do not also spin out a separate "task brief" file — the Review Packet itself is the brief.
- Verification evidence: a structured per-check table — one row per check with command, check type (build / test / typecheck / lint / …), required? (yes/no), ran? (yes/no), real exit status (0 / non-zero / —), and blocked-with-reason when not run — plus a one-line summary. The `gatekeeper` reads the real exit status as authority over reviewer prose (see `agents/gatekeeper.agent.md`, "Command-evidence authority"); a single rollup is surfaced as `udflow:verify=pass|fail|unrun|na`.
- Known risks: remaining uncertainty, migration/rollback concern, external dependency, or runtime limitation.
- Reviewer scope: exact question each selected reviewer should answer.
- Context exclusions: stale decisions, abandoned approaches, or old logs that reviewers should not treat as current.
- External-capability notes: which optional MCP/skills/subagents were used or were unavailable, and any resulting verification gaps.
- Design contract (`design.md`): for UI scope, the **path** to the project's `design.md` when one exists (a pointer, not re-pasted content — `references/design-spec.md`), so `ui-ux-reviewer` judges consistency against it; "none" when absent.

On high-risk work where the plan-grounding step ran (`references/plan-grounding.md`), populate the Acceptance criteria and Reviewer scope from its **sharpened contract**, and seed Verification evidence / expected tests from its **implied edge checklist**. This contract-level intent is the dominant recall lever (see `references/reviewer-selection.md`, *Recall vs precision*), so carry it into the packet rather than re-deriving a vaguer version.

Design contract (design.md path, or "none"):

Shared reviewer contract:
- Report findings as `blocker` / `major` / `minor`; do NOT emit a PASS/CONCERNS/BLOCK verdict — only `gatekeeper` issues `READY` / `FIX REQUIRED` / `NOT READY`.
- Review only the selected scope; be thorough within it but do not invent unrelated concerns; if your discipline has no material impact, mark it not applicable.
- Judge on merits, not pedigree: looking idiomatic/canonical/"intentional"/like a well-known library is not evidence of correctness. A defect is real only if you can name a concrete input or condition that yields a wrong result, leak, crash, or contract violation; then report it.
- Tag a genuine hunch `[unverified]`, never inflate it: if you suspect a defect but your read-only sandbox genuinely cannot run the input that would confirm it, you may surface it prefixed with the literal `[unverified]` (stating what would confirm it) but NOT as `blocker` (cap at `minor`, or `major` only with a named mechanism). Prefer running the input and filing a concrete case; `[unverified]` is the honest channel for what you cannot test, not a way to dodge a reproducible bug. The `gatekeeper` downranks `[unverified]` findings, so they never gate release.
- Rate severity by that failure case's impact (data loss / security / crash / wrong result ⇒ `blocker`/`major`); never downgrade a demonstrated defect to `minor` because the code looks established or "accepted".
- Look for omissions, not only wrong lines: compare behavior to what the name/signature/docstring/requirement imply and flag what is missing (unhandled case, unpaired create/delete cleanup, a required guard/limit/validation, a value like length/default/header that should be set) — anchored to that implied contract, not speculation. Read both sides of a crossed contract: when the change touches one end of a boundary (API response vs consumer type, route/path vs href, state-map key vs its update, producer vs consumer, caller vs callee signature), open the other end in the same pass and confirm they still agree — boundary mismatches are a top omission source, invisible from one side. Grep-verify before asserting an omission: before filing "X is missing", Grep/Read the changed tree to confirm X is genuinely absent — not merely absent from the filtered diff (a starting point, not the whole tree); an omission a quick search would refute is a false positive (a false positive is worse than a documented miss). deferred ≠ missing: work listed in *Out of scope*, or that the plan/user explicitly deferred, is NOT a missing-omission — do not flag intentionally-deferred / out-of-scope / pending follow-up work as an omission; flag only what the in-scope contract implies and is genuinely absent.
- When the packet lists numbered acceptance criteria, evaluate coverage against each within your discipline and flag any not demonstrably met (the `gatekeeper` makes the final per-criterion ruling).
- Reason in the target language's real semantics (truthiness/equality, value-vs-reference and receiver semantics, string/byte/encoding, ownership/lifetimes, numeric overflow), not as generic pseudocode.
- Enumerate; do not stop at the first finding — one real issue does not make the rest of the scope correct.
- A filtered diff is provided as a starting point; you keep full Read/Grep freedom — read the surrounding code whenever the diff is insufficient to judge (omissions and cross-file issues usually require it). The packet states what was trimmed and the exact command to regenerate the same-scoped full diff, so reading more is following a pointer, not guessing. The diff saves a redundant base read; it does not cap your investigation.
- When inspecting, filter noise, not signal — run at minimal verbosity and pull only the decision-relevant output for the content type (diffs → the changed hunks; tests/builds → the failing assertion + first failing frame; logs → error lines + context; searches → `rg -l`/`-c` to locate, then pull context); never drop detail you need to judge correctness.
- Output: scope reviewed; each finding as one compact line — `severity` · `file:line` (or contract/component/path) · the concrete failure or violated contract · smallest safe fix — not a prose paragraph; reference code by `path:line` rather than restating it, and do not echo the diff or file contents already provided in the packet; recommended corrections. Expand a finding to prose only where one line would lose evidence.
```

The "Shared reviewer contract" block above must be filled into every reviewer handoff verbatim — a spawned reviewer cannot reach `reviewer-common.md` by path, so this is how the contract is delivered. Keep it in sync with `reviewer-common.md`.

## Reviewer-Specific Scope

All reviewers report findings as `blocker` / `major` / `minor` (unified vocabulary). Only `gatekeeper` issues a `READY` / `FIX REQUIRED` / `NOT READY` verdict.

- `spec-reviewer`: requirement fidelity, business rules, contract behavior, hidden behavior-changing assumptions.
- `test-reviewer`: missing tests, weak verification, regression risk, edge/failure paths, browser evidence gaps for UI.
- `code-reviewer`: local implementation quality, maintainability, framework usage, resource handling, efficiency on changed paths.
- `security-reviewer`: auth/authz, input handling, secrets, trust boundaries, data exposure, unsafe external or filesystem behavior.
- `architecture-reviewer`: layering, boundaries, dependency direction, orchestration placement, structural drift.
- `operability-reviewer`: logs, observability, retries, timeouts, cancellation, deployment, rollback, diagnosability.
- `ui-ux-reviewer`: usability, interaction flow, layout, states, accessibility basics, responsive behavior.
- `gatekeeper`: aggregate findings, resolve conflicts, judge readiness, decide failure-memory need.

## Full-History Rule

Full thread history is not a review packet. It can contain stale assumptions, abandoned designs, unrelated logs, and sensitive context. Prefer a concise packet with file references and current evidence.

Note: in Claude Code, each subagent runs in its own isolated context window and does not inherit the main thread's history by default, so the "concise packet over full history" discipline is reinforced structurally. Still give each reviewer a focused packet; do not paste raw history.
