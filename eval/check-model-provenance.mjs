// udflow check-model-provenance: a deterministic, repo-root MAINTAINER tool (mirrors
// .github/scripts/validate-structure.mjs and eval/fixture-eval.workflow.js — not shipped under
// udflow/, never installed into a consumer project) that answers one question: does the model you are
// about to rely on match the model eval/baseline.md was last validated against?
//
// Why this exists: EVIDENCE.md documents that the published reviewer recall/false-positive numbers are
// driven mainly by the MODEL, not the reviewer prompts (the v0.9.2 prompts on the current model score the
// same as the current prompts — see EVIDENCE.md, *2026-06-29 run*). So a model upgrade/downgrade is the
// single biggest lever on whether those numbers still hold, and nothing previously checked for that.
//
// This is NOT a SessionStart hook: eval/ is repo-root tooling that never ships to a consumer install, and
// Claude Code only exposes the active model to a hook at SessionStart (and only there) — wiring this as a
// hook would mean shipping a check that fires for every plugin user, almost none of whom have a
// eval/baseline.md to compare against. Run this by hand (or from a release checklist, RELEASING.md) when
// the model you validate against changes, passing the model explicitly via --model.
//
// Dependency-free (Node built-ins only). Fail-open: a missing file, an unparseable provenance line, or no
// --model given yields a "no claim" report, never a crash, and the CLI always exits 0.
